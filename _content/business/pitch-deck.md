## Slides to include in pitch deck

The Story
- The Shift
  - Start with a big, undeniable change that creates stakes. No matter what you’re selling, your most formidable obstacle is prospects’ adherence to the status quo. Your primary adversary, in other words, is a voice inside people’s heads that goes, We’ve gotten along just fine without it, and we’ll always be fine without it.
  - Demonstrate the world has changed in a fundamental way that (1) is undeniable, (2) is happening independently of your company, and (3) gives rise to stakes
- The Enemy
  - Name the enemy. What is stopping the aspiring heroes (marketers? salespeople? your target audience) from reaching their goal?
  - Naming a common enemy will put you and the investors on the same side psychologically
  - (Prove pain exists, Show who has the pain, Use a relatable story)
- The Promised Land
  - Show the future that is possible thanks to having your product
  - This should be both (a) desirable (obviously) and (b) difficult for prospects to reach without you
- The Magic Wand
  - Imagine if... (instead of having to do X, you could do Y)
  - Introduce your product and its unique value proposition through the lens of the benefit to the hero (new capability, easier behavior, etc.)
  - Use pictures to show this benefit
- Proof that the Magic Wand will get people to the Promised Land
  - Testimonials, stats
