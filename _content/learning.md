## Introduction to Learning
### Model and Definitions
_Learning is a cyclical process in which a person is exposed to experiences (either direct or hypothetical) which modify the person's existing knowledge and expectations about the world._

(Insert cyclical picture of Beliefs <---> Experiences)

- BELIEFS → EXPERIENCES ----- Action/Thoughts - Instrumental Rationality
- EXPERIENCES → BELIEFS ----- Induction/Deduction - Epistemic Rationality

- **Belief** = A belief is a part of a person's mental model of the world. It reflects what a person thinks is true about the world, and consequently causes a person to anticipate certain experiences (at the cost of not anticipating an alternative experience). Beliefs are often metaphorically referred to as maps, and are considered valid to the extent that they correctly correspond to the truth. (Read more at [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/))
- **Experience** = The act or process of perceiving an event (this includes both direct encounters of reality as well as perceived situations in thought experiments).

The more an experience differs from a person's expectation, the more room there is to learn. However, isolating variables to minimize that difference can contribute to very effective learning. The following sections will explain how to learn from an experience and how to craft your experiences to maximize learning.

### Experience --> Belief (How to learn from an experience)
This section is about creating beliefs from experiences, and requires exceptional self-reflection. It will explain the necessary realms of formal logic, cognitive biases, and rational reasoning to enable you to learn as quickly and accurately as possible.

These are habits that can be


Epistemic Rationality = the part of rationality which involves achieving accurate beliefs about the world. It involves updating on receiving new evidence, mitigating cognitive biases, and examining why you believe what you believe. It can be seen as a form of instrumental rationality in which knowledge and truth are goals in themselves, whereas in other forms of instrumental rationality, knowledge and truth are only potential aids to achieving goals. ([LessWrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Epistemic_rationality))

Note cognitive biases and logical fallacies here

Can use deductive, abductive, or inductive reasoning

- **Induction (bottom-up)**: the process of inferring a general law from particular instances (Google)
- **Deduction (top-down)**: the process of inferring particular instances from a general law (Google). The process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion. Deductive reasoning links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.



### Belief --> Experience (How to craft experiences to maximize learning)
This is how to choose your experience to maximize your learning

Instrumental Rationality = Instrumental rationality is concerned with achieving goals. More specifically, instrumental rationality is the art of choosing and implementing actions that steer the future toward outcomes ranked higher in one's preferences. Said preferences are not limited to 'selfish' preferences or unshared values; they include anything one cares about. ([LessWrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Instrumental_rationality))

Craft your experiences in an order that will require the least experiences to the most learning (e.g. initial data set, chunking practice, sequential levels up, alternating with full set experiences - each of these are "tools" in your belt for choosing what you need to experience next to learn more quickly). Ideal order?

Design learning experiences: initial data seeding (ML), logical parsing, compression, synthesis (vars, entailments)

Steps to Learn Anything:
- Design (Create experiences) - Obtain useful pieces of information through experiences
- Decide what specifically you want to learn
- Identify keywords related to the chosen topic
- Induction (Create beliefs) - Process information and find the patterns to create beliefs
- Deduction (Act on beliefs) - Iterate on your model by testing beliefs in hypothetical scenarios

Unordered (inexhaustive) list of learning-related hacks:
- Pomodoro
- Sleep
- Repetition / SR
- Teach another person
- Etc.

How to use this model:
1. Subject = Define the subject (contextual)
  - What is X? In what direction do I want to learn?
  - What is my goal?
2. Model = Create a model of the subject
  - What is X composed of? (Mutually exclusive and exhaustive)
  - How do I break down the goal?
3. Definition = Define the parts of the model
  - What are those parts?
  - What are the subgoals?
4. Question = Write the questions to the model
  - What questions do I need to be able to answer to understand X?
  - What do I need to do to accomplish the subgoal?
  - If you had 10min with an expert in X, what would you ask?
  - Who, What, When, Where, Why, Which, How → More info
  - Is, Does → Boolean
5. Answer = Practice answering the questions
  - What are the answers to those questions?
  - What are the answers to “What do I need to do to accomplish the subgoal?”?
6. Practice = Practice behaviors needed to be successful at the subject
  - How do I practice X?
  - How do I do the things necessary to accomplish the subgoal?

Talk to the person you know who is likely to know X best. Ask them who they know who knows X. Ask that person. Repeat through network connections until you are in contact with experts on X. Then ask them the questions listed in the “Steps to learn anything"

* Experience/Pattern --> causal expectation
* Order should be: dissect things correctly, chunk in incremental complexity until intuitive (basal ganglia)
* Endgame first (chess) - each step out adds one level of inference/complexity
* Expectation-Experience back and forth
  * Expectation to experience is created by your choices (which is created by your questions)
  * Experience to expectation/beliefs is modified by your cognitive biases. Here's (link) how to rationally form a model of the world.
- State affects accessing of beliefs - not covered in this
- Decisions also include evaluating alternatives for action in each case (https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_human-relations/s12-01-understanding-decision-making.html)
- Knowing, Habitualize, Intuitive (emotional)
- We can define learning as simply any change to the connections in our neuronal networks.
- An experience either meshes with existing information (intuitive) or doesn’t fit (counterintuitive). What to do in each state.
- Experience can include blueprints (someone else’s learning from their data)
- Practice, isolated drills,
- Superimpose your structure onto the optimal structure
